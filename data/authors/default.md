### Hey there! I'm Shankera 👋

I started coding after high school and fell in love with programming. Near graduation, I decided to pursue DevOps as my career path 🚀

#### My Journey 📖

My first job was as a QA engineer - a perfect stepping stone that taught me a lot about system architecture and automation. Now I'm working as a DevOps engineer, dealing with cloud services, containerization, and automated deployments every day ☁️

#### Tech Stack 🎮

- 🐍 **Languages**: Python
- ☁️ **Cloud**: AWS services
- 🐳 **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes, EKS
- 🔧 **Automation**: Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins
- 🚀 **GitOps**: ArgoCD
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

#### Daily Life ☕

When I'm not working, I enjoy visiting coffee shops and writing tech notes. I believe technology should make life better, not more complicated 😊

#### Little Dream 🏠

My goal is to buy my own cozy place with a comfortable workspace for my mechanical keyboards and multi-monitor setup, plus a small balcony for growing plants 🌱

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in DevOps or tech!
