### About Me

Hello! I'm Shankera Liang, a dedicated professional with a passion for technology, particularly in the realms of Cloud and DevOps. Over the years, I have built a robust foundation in both automated and manual testing as a QA engineer, and I am continuously expanding my expertise in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

#### My Journey

I began my journey in the tech world after graduating from TamKang University with a degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering. My academic background laid the groundwork for a career that has seen me take on roles such as an Automation Test Engineer at Viscovery, where I configured AWS environments, built virtual backend services, and devised automated testing scripts.

#### Skills and Expertise

I have honed my skills in various programming languages and tools, including:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node.js, C++
- **Software Tools**: AWS, Git, MySQL, Terraform, Docker, Jira, Ansible, Jenkins

My work at AppWorks School as a Back-End Trainee and as a Technology & Operations Intern at DBS Bank has provided me with a well-rounded experience in both development and operational aspects of technology projects.

#### Projects and Contributions

I take great pride in my projects, which range from developing shopping websites with React and MySQL to creating automated testing frameworks with FastAPI and Selenium. Some notable projects include:

- **Movie Tickets Website**: A dynamic web application for browsing and booking movie tickets.
- **Smart Pig Farming**: An innovative project monitoring environmental values in pig farms using data visualization techniques.
- **Game Projects**: Developing engaging games like tic-tac-toe and crossword puzzles with Pygame.
