I was registered for AWS workshop, which was conducted by AWS Educate.
There are 2 sessions, one is about AWS Sagemaker and the other is about AWS Amplify.
The workshop also introduced AWS Educate and how to use it, and how to prepare for the
AWS certification.

At the beginning of the workshop, they will give us a link which we can use to log in to
AWS console, so that if some of us don't have AWS account, we can still use the AWS
services.

### AWS Sagemaker

The first session was about AWS Sagemaker. Building a machine learning model by using AWS Sagemaker ,
you don't need to write any code. Just upload the dataset and select the algorithm, Sagemaker will do
the rest. You can also deploy the model using Sagemaker.

### AWS Amplify

If you want to build a web app, you can use AWS Amplify. It is a framework for building web apps. You
can use it to build a web app using React, Vue, Angular, etc. It also has a CLI tool to create a web
app. You can also use it to deploy the web app to AWS.

You don't need to buy a domain name, you can use a subdomain of AWS Amplify. You can also
use your own domain name or use AWS Amplify to host your web app.

The ambassadors of AWS were very intimate, in order to make it easier for novices to get started
with AWS, they provided us with a [github repository](https://github.com/wama-tw/aws-amplify-workshop), which contains the code of the web app
and the commands to deploy the web app to AWS. These commands are very easy to use, just
copy and paste them into the terminal.
