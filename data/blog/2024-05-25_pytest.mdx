## Introduction

Pytest is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable tests. It is widely used in the Python community and has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality.

## What is "Class" in Pytest?

We can use the `class` keyword to define a class in Python. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

```python
class TestClass:
    def test_one(self):
        x = "this"
        assert 'h' in x

    def test_two(self):
        x = "hello"
        assert hasattr(x, 'check')
```

## How to call functions from a class in Pytest?

To call functions from a class in Pytest, we need to create an instance of the class and then call the functions on that instance.

```python
class TestClass:
    def test_one(self):
        x = "this"
        assert 'h' in x

    def test_two(self):
        x = "hello"
        assert hasattr(x, 'check')

def test_class():
    test = TestClass()
    test.test_one()
    test.test_two()
```

## How to run Pytest?

To run Pytest, we need to install the `pytest` package and then run the `pytest` command in the terminal.

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

## what is `fixture` in Pytest?

A fixture is a function that provides a fixed baseline upon which tests can be run. Fixtures are used to initialize objects, set up the environment, and clean up after the test.

### Explain `function`, `class`, `module`, and `session` scopes in Pytest.

- `function`: The fixture is run once for each test function.
- `class`: The fixture is run once for each test class.
- `module`: The fixture is run once for each test module.
- `session`: The fixture is run once for the entire test session.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have learned how to use Pytest to write and run automated tests for Python applications. Pytest is a powerful testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable tests. It has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality and make it easy to integrate with other tools and libraries.
