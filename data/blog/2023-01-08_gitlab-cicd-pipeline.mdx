# What is CI/CD?

CI/CD can let you build, test, and deploy your code automatically.
Want to run CI/CD on your project, you have to create a pipeline job which
is write in yml.

# Build a pipeline job with yml

In your project, you can create a file named `.gitlab-ci.yml` to define your
pipeline job. The file should be in the root directory of your project.

## Define a job

```yml
sample-job:
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"
```

## Define a job with image

```yml
sample-job:
  image: alpine:latest
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"
```

## Define a job with stages

The stages are used to define the order of the job. The job in the same stage
will run in parallel.

```yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"
```

## Define a job with needs

needs let job depends on other jobs. The job will run after the jobs in the
needs list are finished.

```yml
sample-job-1:
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"

sample-job-2:
  needs:
    - sample-job-1
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"
```

## Define a job with environment variables

```yml
sample-job:
  variables:
    MY_VAR: 'Hello World'
  script:
    - echo $MY_VAR
```
