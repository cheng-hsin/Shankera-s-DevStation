# Runner & Executor

When the code is pushed to the GitLab repository,
the GitLab runner will call the executor to execute the job.
The runner is like a commander, it will assign the job to the executor.
The executor(docker images) is like a soldier, it will do the job assigned to it by the commander.

# Two types of GitLab runners

There are two types of runners, shared runners and private runners.
Shared runners are the runners that are shared by all projects.
Private runners are the runners that are only used by the project that they belong to.

# Register a specific runner

If you want to register a specific runner, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the [Install GitLab runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html) page
   to install gitlab-runner.exe.
2. Add a new folder `C:\GitLab Runner` folder
3. Paste the `gitlab-runner.exe` file into the `C:\GitLab Runner` folder
4. Open the command prompt and cd to the `C:\GitLab Runner` folder
5. Run the command
   ```bash
   gitlab-runner.exe register
   ```
6. Enter some information about the runner, the information is as follows:
   - Enter the GitLab instance URL: `https://gitlab.com/`
   - Enter the registration token: `your registration token`
   - Enter the description for the runner: `your runner name`
   - Enter the tags for the runner (comma separated): `your tags`
   - Enter the executor: `pwsh`
   - Enter the default Docker image (e.g. ruby:2.6): `your docker image`
7. Run the command
   ```bash
   gitlab-runner.exe start
   ```
8. Go to the `Settings > General > runners` page to see if the runner is registered successfully.
