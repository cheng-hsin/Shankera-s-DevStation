> I'm a native Chinese speaker. While experimenting with posting longer YouTube videos, I found something surprising about how the language of a title affects a video's visibility.

## Why I Started This Experiment

I’ve always been curious about how people find videos.

I’m not a full-time YouTuber. I don’t have viral editing skills or a huge following. I just post longer videos I record on my phone or computer, in my spare time. But I started noticing that **the language I use in the title has a real impact on who watches**.

So I began a small experiment:  
**Some videos have Chinese titles, some have English titles**. The content is mostly longer-form videos—covering various topics like personal observations, tutorials, or thoughts.

## What I Observed

### Chinese Titles:
- Views spike very quickly right after upload
- Likely boosted by the algorithm to local (Taiwanese/Chinese-speaking) users
- But they die off quickly—after a day or two, traffic drops to nearly zero

### English Titles:
- Almost no views in the beginning
- But they start getting slow, steady views days (or even weeks) later
- Some are clearly getting discovered via **search**, not algorithmic push

This made me ask myself:  
> “Do I want to go viral once, or be discoverable over time?”

## English Isn’t My Native Language—But It Reaches Further

Writing English titles doesn’t feel natural to me.  
Sometimes I’m not even sure if I’m using the right words or tone.

But this itself became a learning process.  
I started watching how others phrase their titles, and I slowly refined mine.

And then something interesting happened:
- I started getting comments from viewers in Brazil, India, the US…
- Some videos with zero algorithmic push were still getting **search-based views**
- People even asked follow-up questions in the comments (this rarely happened on Chinese videos)

## I’m Still Experimenting

I’m still uploading. Still testing different titles, languages, cover thumbnails, and even video lengths.

This isn’t a “success story.” I don’t have big numbers yet. But I enjoy the process.

If you’re also creating content, playing with languages, or studying how audience behavior changes, maybe this post will be useful—or at least relatable.

I plan to keep documenting this journey. Hopefully with more data, I can share clearer insights later on.

## Final Thoughts

This is an ongoing experiment. I have no idea where it will go.

But as long as people are watching—and I’m still learning—I’ll keep posting.
