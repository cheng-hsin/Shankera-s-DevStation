# Runner & Executor

When the code is pushed to the GitLab repository,
the GitLab runner will call the executor to execute the job.
The runner is like a commander, it will assign the job to the executor.
The executor(docker images) is like a soldier, it will do the job assigned to it by the commander.

# Where are the GitLab runners?

They are in the `Settings > General > runners`, then you can see the list of runners.

# Two types of GitLab runners

There are two types of runners, shared runners and private runners.
Shared runners are the runners that are shared by all projects.
Private runners are the runners that are only used by the project that they belong to.

# Register a specific runner

If you want to register a specific runner, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the [Install GitLab runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html) page
   to install gitlab-runner.exe.
2. Add a new folder `C:\GitLab Runner` folder
3. Paste the `gitlab-runner.exe` file into the `C:\GitLab Runner` folder
4. Open the command prompt and cd to the `C:\GitLab Runner` folder
5. Run the command
   ```bash
   gitlab-runner.exe register
   ```
6. Enter some information about the runner, the information is as follows:
   - Enter the GitLab instance URL: `https://gitlab.com/`
   - Enter the registration token: `your registration token`
   - Enter the description for the runner: `your runner name`
   - Enter the tags for the runner (comma separated): `your tags`
   - Enter the executor: `pwsh`
   - Enter the default Docker image (e.g. ruby:2.6): `your docker image`
7. Run the command
   ```bash
   gitlab-runner.exe start
   ```
8. Go to the `Settings > General > runners` page to see if the runner is registered successfully.

9. Run the command
   ```bash
   gitlab-runner.exe run
   ```
   so that the runner can start to work.

# Register a Docker runner on EC2

If you want to register a runner on EC2, follow the steps below.

### Install Docker on EC2 [Install Docker on Amazon Linux 2](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-docker-on-amazon-linux-2/)

1.  Apply pending updates using the yum command:
    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    ```
2.  Search for Docker package:
    ```bash
    sudo yum search docker
    ```
3.  Get version information:
    ```bash
    sudo yum info docker
    ```
4.  Install docker, run:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install docker
    ```
5.  Add group membership for the default ec2-user so you can run all docker commands without using the sudo command:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
    id ec2-user
    newgrp docker
    ```
6.  Start Docker service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable docker.service
    ```
7.  Start the Docker service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start docker.service
    ```

### Need `docker-compose` too? Try this following command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)
sudo mv docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod -v +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Install GitLab runner on EC2 [Install GitLab runner on Amazon Linux 2](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-repository.html)

1.  Add the official GitLab repository:
    ```bash
    curl -L "https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.rpm.sh" | sudo bash
    ```
2.  Install the latest version of GitLab Runner, or skip to the next step to install a specific version:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install gitlab-runner
    ```
3.  To install a specific version of GitLab Runner:
    ```bash
    yum list gitlab-runner --showduplicates | sort -r
    sudo yum install gitlab-runner-10.0.0-1
    ```
4.  Register the runner
